# Workout Kitchen

## Description

There is so much information available online for health and fitness that it is difficult to know where to start, it can be very overwhelming and can discourage people from starting their fitness journey.  
Our app will take the userâ€™s input and give a few workout and recipe ideas that are relevant to them.  
This app will provide recipes and exercises for the user based on their choices.

Several recipe cards are then presented.  
The user then has the option to click the "Down arrow" button to reveal the recipe.  
If the user likes the recipe, they then have the option to save the card to their favourites by clicking the "Save" button.

They can choose from the following:

### Favourites
On opening the Favourites page, the user is presented with all their saved cards for both Recipes and Exercises.  
As with the main page, clicking the "Down arrow" button on recipes, or the "Instructions" button will reveal the appropriate information.

If the user is then done with the card, clicking the "Remove" button will remove the card from their favourites.

# Workout Kitchen

## Description

There is so much information available online for health and fitness that it is difficult to know where to start, it can be very overwhelming and can discourage people from starting their fitness journey.  
Our app will take the userâ€™s input and give a few workout and recipe ideas that are relevant to them.  
This app will provide recipes and exercises for the user based on their choices.
